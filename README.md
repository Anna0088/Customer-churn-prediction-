<h1>Customer Churn Prediction</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The model utilizes a variety of techniques for data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to achieve accurate predictions.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Python</b></li>
  <li><b>Pandas</b></li>
  <li><b>Scikit-learn</b></li>
  <li><b>Matplotlib</b></li>
  <li><b>Seaborn</b></li>
  <li><b>TensorFlow</b></li>
  <li><b>Keras</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h3>1. Data Loading and Cleaning</h3>
<p>The project begins by loading customer data from a CSV file using pandas. Missing values are identified and handled appropriately to ensure data quality.</p>

<h3>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>EDA techniques are employed to gain insights into the data. Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of features like tenure and monthly charges, providing a better understanding of customer behavior.</p>

<h3>3. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Categorical features are converted into numerical representations using one-hot encoding. Features are scaled using MinMaxScaler to ensure optimal model performance.</p>

<h3>4. Model Building and Training</h3>
<p>A neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a portion of the data to learn patterns and relationships associated with customer churn.</p>

<h3>5. Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy. A confusion matrix is generated and visualized using seaborn to understand the types of errors made by the model.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model achieves an accuracy of 80% in predicting customer churn. Further analysis of the confusion matrix reveals insights into precision and recall.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the successful application of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn. The developed model can be used by the telecommunications company to identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.</p>
